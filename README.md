# overhoor

I hacked this together to help my kids learn their languages and prepare their school tests.

Can use data from http://www.woordjesleren.nl/ as input.

Runs on macOS and Linux.

Execute it for some help on how to use it. Supports questioning left to right, right to left and in random order.
